# In this project, our objective was to predict anomalous web traffic using machine learning algorithms. We have used three different datasets namely TOR, IDS2017, and NSL-KDD. In the experiment, we tried bunch of methods like classical machine learning models, boosting, stacking, etc. We also used some advanced libraries like H2O, mlens, etc. In the repository, python code is there for all three different datasets. In this project, I learned about stacking and boosting methods and their importance, feature selection, and dimension reduction techniques. All datasets related to this project can be found in below link.
